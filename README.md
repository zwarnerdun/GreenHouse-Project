# GreenHouse Project
Our project serves as a simulator that will retrieve weather parameters from a specified geographic location. It will recreate items, such as temperature and lighting, at that remote location in a conservatory/greenhouse at a different location on the planet. As well as returning important facts on your plant. 

# Team Efforts
• Payal - sass, weather api, UX

• Robert - firebase, tropicalfruitandveg api

• Bruce - Database/table values

• Zhane - UI design, assist with finding compatible api’s, presentation

# Problem & Solution
• Problem - challenges we faced ultimately were making sure our firebase was responding for our app to work. 

• All that was needed was to make sure read and write were true and make sure the code to initilaize our firebase had the correct content.
